"""
Each Part has consecutive set of Processes to be executed
Each Process requires Resource

Simulation Components follow the naming convention below.

[6Factor Concept]   [Class Object]
Part                Job
Process             Operation
Resource            Machine, Worker, Factory, Line, Transporter, etc.
Source              Source
Sink                Sink
Monitor             Monitor
